# DanceSite
## Overview
This site catalogues the various dances I've been exposed to over my short ballroom dancing career. It was built using the Django python web app framework. It forms part of the project portfolio I developed during my hyperionDev software engineering course.
## Installation
If you're really interested in dancing, and my web dev coding skills (for some reason), simply clone this public repository. The webapp is stored as source.
## Windows usage
The project requires python3 (tested with python 3.11) with the django and Pillow packages installed. After installing python make sure pip is installed by running:
```
 python -m pip install
```
Then, to install django and Pillow:
```
pip install django
pip install Pillow
```
Then, to run the web server locally, open command prompt in the root directory of the project and run
```
python manage.py runserver
```
